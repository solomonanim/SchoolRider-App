                  At SchoolRider, we're on a mission to transform school dismissal from a chaotic 
                  experience into a streamlined, secure, and stress-free process for schools, 
                  parents, and students alike.

                <p className="text-muted-foreground mb-6">
                  SchoolRider was born from a simple observation: the school dismissal process hadn't 
                  evolved in decades, despite advances in technology. Our founders, a group of 
                  parents and educators, experienced firsthand the frustration of long carpool 
                  lines, miscommunication, and safety concerns during dismissal.
                </p>
                <p className="text-muted-foreground mb-6">
                  In 2023, we set out to create a comprehensive solution that would address these 
                  challenges. After consulting with dozens of schools and conducting extensive 
                  research, we developed SchoolRider â€“ a platform specifically designed to 
                  modernize and optimize the school dismissal experience.

                  <p className="text-muted-foreground mb-6">
                    Since launching SchoolRider, we've partnered with over 500 schools nationwide, 
                    helping them save an average of 15 minutes per day during dismissal. That's 
                    more than 45 hours of instructional time reclaimed each school year!
                  </p>
                  <p className="text-muted-foreground">
                    Beyond time savings, schools report improved safety, reduced traffic congestion, 
                    and greater peace of mind for parents. We're proud to be making a positive 
                    difference in school communities across the country.
